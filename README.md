To access the project in unity, follow these steps:
1. Download the file titled 'Source.zip'

6. Double Click on the new Project that got added to the list named 'Viralstorm'
7. From here, you can mess around with the code, the Bolt Flow Macros, all of it!

## Reporting Bugs in the game:
To report a bug, go to the Issues tab on the GitHub Repository and Create a new issue, give it a title, and describe the bug as best as you can.

If you're struggling on writing a good description, you can one of the provided formats.

## How bug reports are organized:
Bug reports are organized in order of Severity, for example: Bugs that cause cause cards to not work properly are considered low priority bugs, whilst bugs that can crash the game, and in some cases completely stop progress are marked as High Priority.

## When bugs will be fixed:
There is no realistic timeframe for bug fixes, since it really depends on how serious the bug is. If it causes the game to crash or messes with save data, then they will take longer to fix. However smaller and less annoying bugs like broken cards and transition errors are simple and wont take long to fix.
