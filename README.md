# Viralstorm 
Welcome to the Viralstorm Homepage! This is where I will (occasionally) link Video Snippets on YT, Itch.io Devblogs, and the most recently uploaded (important) files!

## What is Viralstorm?
Viralstorm is a Card Game made for the Game Off Jam 2021! The link to this game jam is as follows: https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021

## How to access the Project In Unity:
If you want to make any changes to my atrocious coding, then you'll need to be able to open the project in the Unity Editor.

To access the project in unity, follow these steps:
1. Download the file titled 'Source.zip'
2. Extract it using the built in Windows Extractor or a third party alternative like 7Zip/WinRAR
3. Navigate through the extracted folder for a folder titled 'Viralstorm'
4. Open the Unity Hub
5. Click on the ADD button in the top right, and double click ont the Viralstorm folder you found earlier.
6. Double Click on the new Project that got added to the list named 'Viralstorm'
7. From here, you can mess around with the code, the Bolt Flow Macros, all of it!

## Reporting Bugs in the game:
To report a bug, go to the Issues tab on the GitHub Repository and Create a new issue, give it a title, and describe the bug as best as you can.

If you're struggling on writing a good description, you can use the following format:

- [Game Version Here] (This is usually located in the README file inside the download where the game's EXE is located.)

### Summary:
This is where you summarize the bug/glitch, keep it short and sweet.

### Longer Description:
This is where you go into more detail about the events that lead up to the error, what happens exactly over the duration over the glitch, and more.

### Reproduction Steps:
This is where you tell readers how to reproduce this glitch to cause Identical/Very Similar effects.

### Temp Fix Steps:
This is where you tell readers how you temporarily fixed the issue, and how long the effects last for before the bug occurs again.

## How bug reports are organized:
Bug reports are organized in order of Severity, for example: Bugs that cause cause cards to not work properly are considered low priority bugs, whilst bugs that can crash the game, and in some cases completely stop progress are marked as High Priority.
