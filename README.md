# Viralstorm
Welcome to the Viralstorm Homepage! This is where I will (occasionally) link Video Snippets on YT, Itch.io Devblogs, and the most recently uploaded (important) files!

## What is Viralstorm?
Viralstorm is a Card Game made for the Game Off Jam 2021! The link to this game jam is as follows: https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021

## How to access the Project In Unity:
If you want to make any changes to my atrocious coding, then you'll need to be able to open the project in the Unity Editor.

To access the project in unity, follow these steps:
1. Download the file titled 'Source.zip'
2. Extract it using the built in Windows Extractor or a third party alternative like 7Zip/WinRAR
3. Navigate through the extracted folder for a folder titled 'Viralstorm'
4. Open the Unity Hub
5. Click on the ADD button in the top right, and double click ont the Viralstorm folder you found earlier.
6. Double Click on the new Project that got added to the list named 'Viralstorm'
7. From here, you can mess around with the code, the Bolt Flow Macros, all of it!

## Reporting Bugs in the game:
To report a bug, go to the Issues tab on the GitHub Repository and Create a new issue (one sec going to continue this)
